# prod

*prod* is a simple tool that I use to time my Pomodoros.

Start prod shell:

```
$ prod
>>>
```

Get a list of supported commands:

```
>>> help
help
work
break
```

Start your pomodoros and breaks:

```
>>> work
Remaining time: 25:30

>>> break
Remaining time: 3:30
```

Once the time is finished, *prod* will fire both a desktop notification and a sound alarm.
